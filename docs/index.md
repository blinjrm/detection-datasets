# Welcome to detection-dataset

This site contains the project documentation for the
`detection-dataset` project that makes it easy to convert

in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-to guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](./reference/index.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)
