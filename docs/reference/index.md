# API reference

The librairy exposes two main, user-facing classes to facilitate conversion, whether between complete formats
or simply between bounding boxes format.

- [**Converter**](./converter.md): converts datasets between different formats
- [**Bbox**](./bbox.md): converts bounding boxes between different formats.

There are also some internal components that are exposed for advanced users:

- [**Readers**](./readers.md)
