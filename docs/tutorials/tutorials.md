The librairy exposes two main, user-facing classes to facilitate conversion, whether between complete formats
or simply between bounding boxes format.

- [**Read**](../1_Read): Read a dataset from the local filesystem, and upload it to the Hugging Face Hub.  
- [**Transform**](../2_Transform): Read a dataset from the Hub, transform it, and upload it as a new dataset to the Hugging Face Hub.  
- **More to come.**
